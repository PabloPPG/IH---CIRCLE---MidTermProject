# Mid-Term Project
## This is the first project done in Frontend IronHack Bootcamp after the first two weeks. The assignment was to duplicate a specific website, in this case the website was this one: circle.
The project consisted in cloning the "main page", the "contact us" page and the "project page" and making it responsive for mobiles and desktop. Also we had to import the projects section information from a fake API.
